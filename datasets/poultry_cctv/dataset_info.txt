Poultry CCTV Video Sample

Source:
Publicly available CCTV footage downloaded from YouTube.

Data Type:
Video (.mp4)

Description:
This dataset consists of a short CCTV-style video capturing poultry birds
moving freely inside a controlled farm environment. The footage shows multiple
birds entering and exiting the frame with varying motion patterns and partial
occlusions.

Usage in Project:
The video is used as input to the Bird Counting and Weight Estimation pipeline.
It is processed frame-by-frame to:
- Detect poultry birds using a deep learning-based object detector
- Track individual birds across frames using a multi-object tracking algorithm
- Count birds present over time
- Estimate relative weight indices based on bounding box area and motion cues

Preprocessing:
- Video resized to 640x360 resolution
- Frame rate preserved from original source
- No manual annotations were applied to the raw video

Ethical and Licensing Notes:
The video is publicly accessible and contains no personal or sensitive data.
It is used only for demonstration and evaluation of computer vision algorithms.
All rights remain with the original content creator.

Limitations:
- No ground-truth labels are available
- Weight estimation is relative, not absolute
